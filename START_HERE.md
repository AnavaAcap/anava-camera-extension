## 🔑 Key Facts

### What's Working
- ✅ Binary is signed (Developer ID Application)
- ✅ Installer works on macOS 11+
- ✅ Proxy service auto-starts
- ✅ Native messaging configured

### What Needs Attention
- ⚠️ Extension ID is `PLACEHOLDER_EXTENSION_ID` (needs replacement)
- ⚠️ Package is unsigned (need Developer ID Installer cert for production)

### Is It Generic?
**YES!** Once you replace the placeholder ID, it will work for **any user** who installs it. The installer:
- Uses system-wide paths
- Auto-detects the logged-in user
- No user-specific configuration needed
- Works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
