## ‚è≥ TO DO (Requires External Dependencies - 2-4 weeks)

### 1. Code Signing Certificates

**What**: Digital signatures required for installer trust

**macOS** ($99/year):
- Sign up for Apple Developer Program
- Generate Developer ID Installer certificate
- Notarize installers with Apple

**Windows** ($200-400/year):
- Purchase Authenticode certificate (DigiCert, Sectigo, etc.)
- Sign .msi installer

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for approval/delivery
**Cost**: $300-500/year
**Blocking**: Can't publish signed installers without this

---

### 2. Backend OAuth Endpoints

**What**: Implement PKCE OAuth 2.0 endpoints in your terraform-spa backend

**Required Endpoints**:
- `GET /oauth/authorize` - Start OAuth flow
- `POST /oauth/token` - Exchange code for token (with PKCE validation)
- `GET /oauth/callback` - Handle redirect

**Reference**: See `examples/web-app-connector.ts` (lines 329-516) for complete backend code

**Timeline**: 1-2 days development + testing
**Blocking**: OAuth authentication won't work without this

---

### 3. Chrome Web Store Submission

**What**: Publish extension to Chrome Web Store

**Steps**:
1. Create developer account ($5 one-time)
2. Reserve extension ID
3. Replace ALL placeholders with real extension ID
4. Upload extension zip
5. Fill out listing (screenshots, description, privacy policy)
6. Submit for review

**Timeline**:
- Setup: 1 hour
- Review: 1-3 business days
- Total: ~1 week

**Blocking**: Need signed installers first (for professional launch)

---

### 4. Final Testing

**What**: Test on clean VMs before launch

**Platforms to Test**:
- macOS 11, 12, 13, 14 (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- Windows 10, 11
- Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04

**Timeline**: 1-2 days (can parallelize)
**Blocking**: Should test signed installers on real systems

---

## üìã Recommended Order

### Phase 1: Local Testing (TODAY - 1 hour)
1. Generate icons
2. Build binary
3. Build extension
4. Run automated tests
5. Test manually in Chrome

**Goal**: Verify everything works on your machine

---

### Phase 2: Backend Integration (THIS WEEK - 1-2 days)
1. Implement OAuth endpoints in terraform-spa
2. Deploy to development environment
3. Test PKCE flow end-to-end
4. Fix any integration issues

**Goal**: OAuth authentication working

---

### Phase 3: Code Signing (NEXT 1-2 WEEKS - External)
1. Purchase certificates (Apple + Windows)
2. Set up signing in CI/CD
3. Build signed installers
4. Test on clean VMs

**Goal**: Production-ready installers

---

### Phase 4: Chrome Web Store (WEEK 3-4)
1. Create developer account
2. Reserve extension ID
3. Update all placeholders
4. Create listing materials (screenshots, privacy policy)
5. Submit for review
6. Address reviewer feedback (if any)

**Goal**: Extension live on Chrome Web Store
