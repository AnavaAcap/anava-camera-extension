# Chrome Extension Authentication Fix - Changes Summary

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/services/CameraAuthentication.ts`
**Before**: Used `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` to communicate with background worker  
**After**: Direct XMLHttpRequest authentication in popup context

**Key Changes**:
- Removed background worker message passing (lines 84-104 deleted)
- Added `tryBasicAuth()` using XMLHttpRequest (lines 116-222)
- Added `tryDigestAuth()` using XMLHttpRequest (lines 227-370)
- Added full MD5 implementation for Digest auth (lines 376-521)
- **Result**: ~420 lines, all authentication self-contained

**Why**: Background service worker approach failed - Chrome keeps workers "inactive" and fetch() still triggered popups

---

### 2. `/src/services/CameraDiscovery.ts`
**Before**: Used `fetch()` API for TCP connection checks  
**After**: XMLHttpRequest for all network probing

**Key Changes**:
- Replaced `fetch()` calls in `checkForCamera()` (lines 285, 299)
- Changed from `fetch()` to `checkTCPConnectionXHR()` method
- New `checkTCPConnectionXHR()` method (lines 386-414) replaces old `checkTCPConnection()` fetch-based method

**Why**: fetch() triggers browser auth popup on 401 responses, XHR does not

---

### 3. `/background.js`
**Status**: NOW UNUSED (can be removed in future cleanup)

**Before**: Had full MD5 + Digest auth implementation expecting to handle auth requests  
**After**: Service worker never wakes up reliably in Chrome MV3, authentication popups still triggered

**Why Keep**: Safe to leave for now, no harm, can delete in cleanup pass

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Load extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions` â†’ Load unpacked)
- [ ] Test single camera: `192.168.50.156:80` with `anava`/`baton`
- [ ] Verify NO browser authentication popup appears
- [ ] Test network scan: `192.168.50.0/24`
- [ ] Verify scanning completes to IP .254 (not stopping at .150)
- [ ] Check DevTools console for authentication success logs
- [ ] Test with HTTPS camera (port 443)
- [ ] Test with Digest auth camera
