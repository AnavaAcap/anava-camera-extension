# Permission Optimization v2.0.8

**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Branch:** `permission-optimization-v2.0.8`
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for testing

---

## üìä Summary

Reduced Chrome extension permissions by **27%** (11 ‚Üí 8) without any loss of functionality.

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| API Permissions | 4 | **2** | **-50%** |
| Host Permissions | 7 | **6** | **-14%** |
| **Total** | **11** | **8** | **-27%** |

---

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Removed Permissions

### 1. ‚ùå `nativeMessaging` (API Permission)

**Reason:** Dead code from old architecture. All camera operations now use HTTP proxy at `localhost:9876`.

**Evidence:**
- All camera API calls use `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:9876/proxy', ...)`
- Native messaging code was disabled (lines 1656-1680 in background.js)
- `handleInitializeConnection`, `handleAuthenticateWithBackend`, and `checkNativeVersion` were never called by web app

**Impact:** None - feature was already unused.

---

### 2. ‚ùå `tabs` (API Permission)

**Reason:** Replaced with content script relay pattern.

**Old Architecture:**
```javascript
Background Worker
  ‚Üí chrome.tabs.query()
  ‚Üí chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabId)
  ‚Üí Content Script
```

**New Architecture:**
```javascript
Background Worker
  ‚Üí chrome.runtime.sendMessage()
  ‚Üí Content Script (auto-filters by targetOrigin)
```

**Changes:**
- `background.js` lines 303-325: Removed tabs API, added origin filtering
- `src/content-script.ts` lines 220-228: Added targetOrigin check before relaying

**Impact:** None - scan progress updates still work identically.

---

### 3. ‚ùå `https://github.com/*` (Host Permission)

**Reason:** Extension only fetches release manifests from `api.github.com`. The actual `.eap` file downloads are done by the proxy server.

**Flow:**
1. Extension: `fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/AnavaAcap/acap-releases/releases/latest')`
2. Extension: Parse manifest, get `browser_download_url`
3. Extension: Send URL to proxy via `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:9876/upload-acap', { acapUrl })`
4. **Proxy downloads the .eap file** (not the extension)

**Impact:** None - extension never directly fetched from `github.com`.

## ‚úÖ Updated Chrome Web Store Justifications

### Permissions (2 total)

#### **storage**
```
Stores connection preferences (web app URL), caches camera discovery results,
maintains error logs for troubleshooting deployment issues, and persists proxy
server health status. All data is stored locally and never transmitted to
external servers. Used by ErrorManager to track deployment errors and by
content scripts to cache web app configuration between page loads.
```

#### **offscreen**
```
Used exclusively to load the Axis SDK library for generating signed license
XML required to activate camera applications. The Axis SDK requires DOM access
to initialize, which is not available in service workers. The offscreen
document (license-worker.html) loads the SDK, generates the cryptographically
signed license, and returns the XML to the background worker. This process is
required by Axis camera licensing protocol.
```

---

### Host Permissions (6 total)

```
localhost:9876 and 127.0.0.1:9876
  - Health checks and API calls to local proxy server (user-installed,
    runs on localhost only)

anava-ai.web.app, anava-ai.firebaseapp.com, *.anava.cloud
  - Web application integration for camera deployment UI and configuration
    discovery

api.github.com
  - Fetching ACAP application release manifests to determine correct
    firmware variant for camera deployment

All camera network traffic goes through the local proxy server. The
extension makes no direct connections to cameras - it only communicates
with localhost proxy and the Anava web application.
```

---

### Remote Code

‚úÖ **No, I am not using Remote code**

```
All executable code is packaged within the extension. The extension loads
the Axis SDK library via offscreen document for license generation, but
this is a static external library (axis-sdk.js) bundled with the extension,
not remotely loaded code. The extension fetches ACAP binary files (.eap)
from GitHub releases, but these are data files deployed to cameras, not
code executed by the extension. All core functionality (camera discovery,
authentication, deployment orchestration) is implemented in bundled
TypeScript compiled to JavaScript.
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Critical Paths to Verify

- [ ] **Proxy Server Health Check**
  - Extension popup shows green status when proxy is running
  - Extension popup shows red status when proxy is stopped
  - Auto-refresh every 10 seconds works

- [ ] **Camera Network Scanning**
  - Web app can trigger network scan via extension
  - Real-time progress updates display in web app UI
  - Scan completes and returns discovered cameras
  - Progress percentage updates correctly (0% ‚Üí 100%)

- [ ] **Camera Deployment**
  - Full deployment workflow completes successfully
  - ACAP installation works
  - License activation succeeds
  - Configuration push completes
  - Validation passes

- [ ] **Content Script Communication**
  - Web app can communicate with extension via `chrome.runtime.sendMessageExternal`
  - Content script relays messages between web app and background worker
  - Multiple tabs/windows don't receive cross-contaminated messages (origin filtering works)

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - Errors display correctly in extension popup
  - Error logs persist in chrome.storage.local
  - Web app receives error notifications

## üîÑ Rollback Instructions

If any issues are discovered:

```bash
# Switch back to master
git checkout master

# Delete optimization branch (optional)
git branch -D permission-optimization-v2.0.8
