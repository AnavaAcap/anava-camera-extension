## Implementation Complete

### Files Modified
- `/src/services/CameraAuthentication.ts` (590 ‚Üí 160 lines, 73% reduction)
- `/background.js` (no changes - already had authentication)

### Key Changes
- Removed ALL XHR code from popup context
- Replaced with `chrome.runtime.sendMessage()` to background worker
- Background worker handles Digest auth silently (no popup)

### Build Output
```
‚úÖ TypeScript compiled successfully
‚úÖ Extension built in dist/ folder
‚úÖ Ready to load in Chrome
```

1. Load extension from `dist/` folder in Chrome
2. Enter camera credentials
3. Click "Test Connection"
4. **CRITICAL**: Verify NO browser popup appears

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Extension loads in Chrome without errors
- [ ] NO browser popup appears during authentication
- [ ] Console shows Digest auth flow
- [ ] Camera device info returned: "AXIS M3086-V" / "ACCC8EA27231"

## Technical Solution

**Problem**: XHR in popup context triggers browser auth popup on 401
**Solution**: All authentication moved to background service worker

**Why it works**: Chrome doesn't show auth popups for background worker requests

## Next Action

**Load extension and test with camera to verify NO POPUP appears**
