# Bug Fixes - Login Popup, Progress Display, Blank Selection

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Browser Login Popup
**Problem**: Browser was showing HTTP Basic Authentication popup whenever camera returned 401 status
**Root Cause**: Fetch API sends unauthenticated request first, browser intercepts 401 before JavaScript can handle it
**Fix**: Include `Authorization: Basic` header in **first** HTTP request (line 88-90 in CameraAuthentication.ts)

```typescript
// For HTTP, send Basic auth immediately to prevent browser popup
if (protocol === 'http') {
  const basicAuth = btoa(`${username}:${password}`);
  headers['Authorization'] = `Basic ${basicAuth}`;
}
```

**Result**: No more login popups! Credentials sent immediately on HTTP connections.

### 2. ‚úÖ Progress Display Only Showing Batch Bounds
**Problem**: Progress text showed "Scanning 192.168.50.254 (254/254)" for entire batch, not individual IPs
**Root Cause**: Only sending progress update after entire batch completed
**Fix**: Send progress update for EACH IP in batch (line 245-252 in CameraDiscovery.ts)

```typescript
// Send progress update for EACH IP in the batch
for (const task of batchTasks) {
  this.sendProgress({
    ip: `${task.ip} (${scannedCount}/${totalIPs})`,
    status: 'scanning',
    details: this.adaptiveScanner!.getPerformanceSummary()
  });
}
```

**Result**: Progress bar updates for every single IP scanned, not just batch boundaries.

### 3. ‚úÖ Blank Camera Selection Window
**Problem**: After scan completes, Step 2 (Select) showed blank white window
**Root Cause**: Progress section still visible, covering camera list
**Fix**: Hide progress section before displaying cameras (line 119 in popup.js)

```javascript
// Move to selection step
progressSection.style.display = 'none';  // Added this line
displayCameras(cameras);
goToStep(2);
```

**Result**: Camera cards display immediately after scan completes.

## Testing Instructions

1. **Reload Extension**:
   ```
   chrome://extensions/ ‚Üí Find "Anava Camera Discovery & Deployment" ‚Üí Click reload icon
   ```

2. **Test No Login Popup**:
   - Click extension icon
   - Enter network: `192.168.50.0/24`
   - Enter credentials: `anava` / `baton`
   - Click "Start Scan"
   - **Expected**: No browser login popup appears
   - **Watch Console**: Should see "‚úì Found Axis device at 192.168.50.156 (HTTP:80 200)"

3. **Test Progress Updates**:
   - Watch progress text during scan
   - **Expected**: Shows each IP individually:
     - "Scanning 192.168.50.1 (1/254)"
     - "Scanning 192.168.50.2 (2/254)"
     - "Scanning 192.168.50.3 (3/254)"
     - etc.
   - **NOT**: Jumps from 1 to 20 to 40 (batch boundaries)

4. **Test Camera Selection**:
   - After scan completes (finds camera at .156)
   - **Expected**: Automatically advances to Step 2
   - **Expected**: Camera card visible with:
     - Model name
     - IP: 192.168.50.156:80
     - Firmware version
     - Protocol: HTTP
     - Serial number
     - Green "Supported" badge
   - **NOT**: Blank white window

## Technical Details

### Browser Authentication Popup
Browsers have built-in HTTP Basic Auth handling that shows a native popup when:
1. Server returns `401 Unauthorized`
2. Response includes `WWW-Authenticate: Basic` header
3. Request did NOT include `Authorization` header

**Solution**: Include auth in first request so browser never sees 401.

**Why this works**:
- HTTP uses Basic auth (username:password base64 encoded)
- HTTPS uses Digest auth (requires challenge-response, 401 is expected)
- By sending Basic auth immediately on HTTP, we skip the 401 entirely

### Progress Batch Updates
The adaptive scanner processes IPs in batches (default 20 at a time) for performance:
- Batch 1: IPs 1-20 (scanned in parallel)
- Batch 2: IPs 21-40 (scanned in parallel)
- Batch 3: IPs 41-60 (scanned in parallel)

**Before**: Progress updated once per batch (at IP 20, 40, 60...)
**After**: Progress updated for each IP in batch (1, 2, 3... 20, 21, 22...)

### Camera Display Timing
The flow is:
1. Scan completes ‚Üí `discoveredCameras` array populated
2. Call `displayCameras(cameras)` ‚Üí Creates DOM elements
3. Call `goToStep(2)` ‚Üí Shows Step 2 section
4. Progress section must be hidden BEFORE step 2 visible

**Before**: Progress section overlaid camera list
**After**: Progress hidden, cameras visible

## Files Modified

1. **src/services/CameraAuthentication.ts**:
   - Lines 81-91: Added Basic auth header for HTTP protocol
   - Prevents browser login popup

2. **src/services/CameraDiscovery.ts**:
   - Lines 245-252: Loop through batch tasks for progress updates
   - Shows individual IP progress

3. **popup.js**:
   - Line 119: Hide progress section before showing cameras
   - Fixes blank window issue

```

**Key Difference**: No browser popup, no 401 responses for HTTP cameras!

## Remaining Known Issues

### Scan Speed
- Still processing 254 IPs even with "Fast" mode
- Aggressive mode uses larger batches but still scans entire range
- **Potential optimization**: Skip IPs that don't respond to ping (requires native host)

### HTTPS Cameras
- HTTPS cameras with self-signed certs still fall back to HTTP
- This is expected behavior (browsers reject invalid certs)
- HTTP fallback works correctly

## Next Steps

1. Test all three fixes work together
2. Verify no regressions in deployment flow
3. Consider adding scan cancellation button
4. Add "Rescan" button in camera selection view
