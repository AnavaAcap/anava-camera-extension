## üìù Store Listing Content

### Item Name
```
Anava Local Connector
```

### Summary (132 characters max)
```
Connect to Axis cameras on your local network. Bridge between web apps and network devices. Requires companion app.
```

### Detailed Description
```markdown
# Anava Local Connector

Connect to Axis network cameras directly from your browser with the Anava Local Connector Chrome extension.

## What It Does

This extension bridges the gap between web applications and network cameras on your local network. It enables browser-based tools to:

- üîç Discover Axis cameras on your local network
- üîê Authenticate with camera credentials
- üì¶ Deploy ACAP applications remotely
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configure camera settings via VAPIX API
- üìä Monitor camera firmware and status

## How It Works

1. Install the Anava Local Connector extension (this extension)
2. Install the companion native application (required - separate download)
3. Launch the companion app to enable network access
4. Visit an authorized Anava web application
5. The extension automatically bridges communication between the web app and your cameras

## Requirements

- **Companion Application**: This extension requires the "Anava Local Connector" native application to be installed on your computer. The companion app handles network communication that browsers cannot directly access.
  - Download: [Insert download link after native app is published]
  - Supported OS: macOS, Windows, Linux

- **Network Access**: Cameras must be on the same network as your computer (or accessible via VPN/routing)

- **Camera Compatibility**: Axis cameras running firmware 11.11+ (OS11 or OS12)

## Privacy & Security

- ‚úÖ All data stored locally on your device only
- ‚úÖ Camera credentials never transmitted to external servers
- ‚úÖ Communication with cameras uses HTTPS and digest authentication
- ‚úÖ Open source - review the code yourself
- ‚úÖ No tracking, no analytics, no third-party data sharing

Read our full privacy policy: [Your Privacy Policy URL]

## Open Source

This extension is open source. View the code, report issues, or contribute:
https://github.com/AnavaAcap/anava-camera-extension

## Support

- Documentation: [Your docs URL]
- Issues: https://github.com/AnavaAcap/anava-camera-extension/issues
- Email: [Your support email]

## Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Version 88+ (Manifest V3 support)
- **Chromium-based browsers**: Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera (untested but should work)
- **Cameras**: Axis cameras with firmware 11.11.0 or higher

## Why Native Messaging?

Web browsers cannot directly access local network devices due to security restrictions. The companion native application runs on your computer with full network access, while the extension securely bridges communication between your browser and the companion app.

---

**Note**: This extension is designed for professional use in camera deployment and management scenarios. It requires technical knowledge of network configuration and Axis camera systems.
```

### Screenshots Guidance

Create 3-5 screenshots showing:

1. **Extension Popup** - Shows connection status and link to web app
   - Size: 640x400 or 1280x800
   - Show green "Connected" status

2. **Web App Camera Discovery** - Browser discovering cameras on network
   - Show list of discovered cameras
   - Demonstrate network scanning UI

3. **Camera Configuration** - Configuring camera settings
   - Show camera details and configuration interface

4. **Deployment Progress** - ACAP deployment in action
   - Show progress indicators and status messages

5. **Native App Running** - Screenshot of companion app
   - Show that it's running in background/system tray

**Screenshot Tips**:
- Use clean, professional examples
- Annotate with arrows or highlights if helpful
- Remove any sensitive information (real IPs, credentials)
- Use consistent theme/styling
- Show actual functionality, not just UI

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Post-Approval Steps

### The Extension ID Problem

Once approved, Chrome Web Store will assign a **permanent extension ID**. This ID is different from your development ID.

**Current State**:
- Development ID: Variable (changes each time you load unpacked)
- Store ID: **Will be assigned upon approval** (e.g., `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456`)

**Problem**: The native host manifest has a placeholder for the extension ID:
```json
{
  "allowed_origins": [
    "chrome-extension://PLACEHOLDER_EXTENSION_ID/"
  ]
}
```

**Solution**: After approval, you MUST:

1. **Get Your Extension ID**
   - Install from Chrome Web Store
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Find "Anava Local Connector"
   - Copy the extension ID (long alphanumeric string)

2. **Update Native Host Manifests**

   Update these files with your real extension ID:
   - `installers/macos/com.anava.local_connector.json`
   - `installers/windows/com.anava.local_connector.json`
   - Native host manifest templates

   **macOS** (`~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anava.local_connector.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "name": "com.anava.local_connector",
     "description": "Anava Local Connector for camera network access",
     "path": "/Applications/AnavaLocalConnector/local-connector",
     "type": "stdio",
     "allowed_origins": [
       "chrome-extension://YOUR_REAL_EXTENSION_ID_HERE/"
     ]
   }
   ```

   **Windows** (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Google\Chrome\NativeMessagingHosts\com.anava.local_connector`):
   ```
   Path to: C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\AnavaLocalConnector\com.anava.local_connector.json
   ```

3. **Rebuild Native App Installers**
   - Update installer packages with correct extension ID
   - Redistribute to users
   - Update download links in store listing

4. **Update Web App Integration**
   - Update `anava-infrastructure-deployer` environment variable
   - Set `VITE_EXTENSION_ID=YOUR_REAL_EXTENSION_ID`
   - Redeploy web application

5. **Test End-to-End**
   - Install extension from Chrome Web Store
   - Install updated native app
   - Verify connection in extension popup (should show green dot)
   - Test camera discovery from web app

### Updating the Extension

When you need to release updates:

1. Increment version in `package.json` and `manifest.json`
2. Build: `npm run build`
3. Create new submission package: `./create-submission-package.sh`
4. Upload new ZIP to developer console (same item, new version)
5. Submit for review

Updates typically review faster than initial submissions (1-2 days).
